                <h2>Environment</h2>
                <p>Fast fashion harms the planet by producing clothes from cheap materials that wear out quickly and end up as waste. Factories use dyes and chemicals that pollute rivers and air, while the massive production of clothes adds a large carbon footprint.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h2>Workers</h2>
                <p>Most fast fashion is made in developing countries, where workers often face unfair conditions. They are paid very little, work long hours, and sometimes do so in unsafe or unhealthy environments just to keep costs low.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h2>Consumers</h2>
                <p>For shoppers, fast fashion feels cheap and exciting, but the clothes don’t last. This makes people buy more and throw away faster, creating a throwaway culture where fashion is treated as disposable instead of something to value.</p>

                <p>Instead of buying lots of cheap clothes, focus on fewer pieces that are higher quality and last longer. Think of timeless styles you can wear many times.</p>

            It all starts with us to make the change. Every choice we make—what we buy, what we wear, and how we treat our clothes—shapes the future of fashion. Fast fashion might seem fun and easy, but its impact on the planet, workers, and even ourselves is heavy. By slowing down, buying less, thrifting, or caring for what we already own, we’re proving that style doesn’t have to destroy the Earth. Change doesn’t need to be huge at once—it begins with small steps, and those steps begin with us.
